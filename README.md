# Univent

UNIVENT, or the Unified University Events Platform, is a centralized digital solution designed as a website and mobile application to streamline campus engagement at Middle East Technical University (METU). Developed using the Design Thinking framework, the platform addresses the challenge of fragmented information by aggregating all student club and university activities into a single, reliable hub. For students, it offers features like a personalized "For You" feed and a synchronized calendar to simplify event discovery and resolve scheduling conflicts. Simultaneously, it empowers student organizations by providing a dashboard with anonymous pre-event interest metrics, helping club leaders move from speculative to strategic, data-driven planning.
